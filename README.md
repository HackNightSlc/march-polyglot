March Polyglot Code-off Repository
==============

The shared repository for the March 28 Polyglot Code-off. Simply fork this repository, 
build your application in your forked repository (and update the README.md please), 
and then share your work by submitting a pull request to the original project **on the branch of your username**.

This isn't a "my tools are better than yours" competition. It's more of a "this is how we do X on my side of the fence" experiment.
